This is a programming exercise, implemented two different ways. One approach is the traditional algorithmic reverse polish notation/shunting yard algorithm, the other is the declarative / functional approach with DSLs. All in Ruby. The git TAGS point you to the different codebases. You make your pick, I'm no judge. Whatever.

PS.
You should have chosen the functional approach.
